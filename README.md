# KlamathOpsModel
This repository contains the Klamath RiverWare Operations Model (KROM), a daily timestep water management model. The repository is structured as follows - 
* *Database* - model input data
* *Documentation* - model documentation
* *Models* - model files
* *Rulesets* - model ruleset files
* *SCTs* - model system control files

Model documentation in the *Documentation* folder describes model history, model development, and detailed model description. 

KROM was developed in [RiverWare](http://riverware.org/), a water systems modeling platform developed by the Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems ([CADSWES](https://www.colorado.edu/cadswes/)) at the University of Colorado, Boulder to support water management by the Bureau of Reclamation's [Klamath Basin Area Office](https://www.usbr.gov/mp/kbao/).
