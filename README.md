This repository contains the Klamath Planning and Operations Model (KPOM), a daily timestep water management model. The repository is structured as follows -
* *Database* - model input data
* *Documentation* - model documentation
* *Models* - model files
* *Outputs* - model reports outputs
* *PAViewer* - current version of PA Viewer linked to output DMI in KPOM
* *RiverSMART* - draft of a RiverSMART version of the model. There is known bug with this model: https://cadswes.atlassian.net/browse/RW-6811?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZWUzZWQyYTA1ZTJjNGIyZjgzMTQyZmE3OWFlZjMxZDgiLCJwIjoiaiJ9
* *SCTs* - model system control files

KPOM was developed in [RiverWare](http://riverware.org/), a water systems modeling platform, developed by the Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems ([CADSWES](https://www.colorado.edu/cadswes/)) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, to support water management by the Bureau of Reclamation's [Klamath Basin Area Office](https://www.usbr.gov/mp/kbao/).
